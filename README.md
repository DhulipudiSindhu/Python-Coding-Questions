Modules and Packages

A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

Create a Module:

To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py:
Example
Save this code in a file named mymodule.py

Use a Module:

Now we can use the module we just created, by using the import statement:
Example
Import the module named mymodule, and call the greeting function:

import mymodule

Built-in Modules:

There are several built-in modules in Python, which you can import whenever you like.

import datetime   
import json
